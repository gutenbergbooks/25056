    <h2>
      THE BROTHERS-IN-LAW: <br /> A TALE OF THE EQUATORIAL ISLANDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Tâvita the teacher, pointing with his paddle to a long,
      narrow peninsula which stretched out into the shallow waters of the
      lagoon, &ldquo;there, that is the place where the battle was fought. In those
      days a village of thirty houses or more stood there; now no one liveth
      there, and only sometimes do the people come here to gather cocoanuts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The White Man nodded. &ldquo;'Tis a fair place to look upon. Let us land and
      rest awhile, for the sun is hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The native pastor swung the bow of the canoe round towards the shore, and
      presently the little craft glided gently upon the hard, white sand, and
      the two men got out, walked up to the grove of cocoa-palms, and sat down
      under their shade to rest and smoke until the sun lost some of its fierce
      intensity and they could proceed on their journey homeward to the
      principal village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The White Man was the one trader living in Peru,{*} the native was a
      Samoan, and one of the oldest and bravest missionaries in the Pacific. For
      twenty years he had dwelt among the wild, intractable, and savage people
      of Peru&mdash;twenty years of almost daily peril, for in those days the
      warlike people of the Gilbert Group resented the coming of the few native
      teachers scattered throughout the archipelago, and only Tavita's undaunted
      courage and genial disposition had preserved the lives of himself and his
      family. Such influence as he now possessed was due, not to his persistent
      attempts to preach Christianity, but to his reputation for integrity of
      conduct and his skill as a fisherman and carpenter.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Francis Island, or Peru, is one of the largest atolls of
     the Gilbert Group in the South Pacific, about one hundred
     and twenty miles south of the Equator
</pre>
    <p>
      The White Man and he were firm friends, and that day they had been down to
      the north end of the lagoon to collect a canoe load of the eggs of a small
      species of tern which frequented the uninhabited portion of the island in
      myriad swarms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, as they sat and smoked, and lazily watched a swarm of the
      silvery mullet called <i>kanae</i> disporting themselves on the glassy
      surface of the lagoon, the White Man said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were these white men, Tâvita, who fought in the battle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast never heard the story?&rdquo; inquired the teacher in Samoan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trader shook his head. &ldquo;Only some of it&mdash;a little from one, a
      little from another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then listen,&rdquo; said Tâvita, re-filling his pipe and leaning his broad back
      against the bole of a cocoa-palm.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nineteen years ago, and I had been living on the island but a
      year. In those days there were many white men in these islands. Some were
      traders, some were but <i>papalagi tafea</i>{*} who spent their days in
      idleness, drunkenness, and debauchery, casting aside all pride and living
      like these savage people, with but a girdle of grass around their naked
      waists, their hands ever imbued in the blood of their fellow white men or
      that of the men of the land.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Beachcombers.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, on this island, were two traders and many beachcombers. One of the
      traders was a man named Carter, the other was named West Carter the people
      called 'Karta,' the other by his fore name, which was 'Simi' (Jim). They
      came here together in a whaleship from the Bonin Islands with their wives&mdash;two
      sisters, who were Portuguese half-castes, and both very beautiful women.
      Carter's wife had no children; West, who was the younger man, and who had
      married the younger sister, had two. Both brought many thousands of
      dollars worth of trade with them to buy cocoanut oil, for in those days
      these natives here did not make copra as they do now&mdash;they made oil
      from the nuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Karta built a house on the north end of the island, where there is the
      best anchorage for ships, West chose to remain on the lee side where he
      had landed, and bought a house near to mine. In quite a few days we became
      friends, and almost every night we would meet and talk, and his children
      and mine played together. He was quite a young man, and had been, he told
      me, the third mate of an English ship which was cast away on the Bonin
      Islands four years before, where he had met Karta, who was a trader there,
      and whose wife's sister he married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day they heard from the captain of a whaleship that there was much
      money to be made on this island of Peru, for although there were many
      beachcombers living here there was no trader to whom the people could sell
      their oil. So that was why they came here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, although these two men were married to two sisters, there was but
      little love between them, and then as time went on came distrust, and then
      hatred, born out of Karta's jealousy and wicked heart; but until they came
      to live here on Peru there had been no bad blood&mdash;not even enough to
      cause a bitter word, though even then the younger man did not like Karta,
      who was a man of violent temper, unfaithful to his wife, and rude and
      insulting in his manner to most men, white or brown. And Serena, his wife,
      hated him, but made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As time went on, both men prospered, for there was much oil to be had,
      and at the end of the first year a schooner came from Sydney and bought it
      I went on board with Simi, after the oil had been rafted off to the ship's
      side. Karta, too, came on board to be paid for his oil. He had been
      drinking much grog and his face was flushed and angry. With him were three
      beachcombers whose foul language and insolent demeanour angered both the
      captain and Simi, who were quiet men. There were six or seven of these
      beachcombers living on the island, and they all disliked Simi, who would
      have none of their company; but in Karta's house they were made welcome.
      Night after night they would gather there and drink and gamble, for some
      of them had bags of dollars, for dissolute and idle as they were for the
      most of their time they could make money easily by acting as interpreters
      for the natives, to the captains of the whaleships, or as pilots to the
      trading vessels sailing northward to the Marshall Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain paid Simi partly in money and partly in trade goods, for the
      two hundred casks of oil he bought, and then Simi and I turned to go on
      shore. Karta had scarce spoken ten words to Simi, who yet bore him no
      ill-will, although for many months tales had come to us of the evil life
      he led and the insults he put upon his wife Serena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after he had bidden farewell to the captain, Simi held out his hand
      to his brother-in-law and said&mdash;'My wife Luisa sendeth love and
      greetings to Serena. Is she in good health?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Karta would not take the hand held out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What is that to thee or thy wife either?' he answered rudely. 'Look to
      thy own business and meddle not with mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi's face grew red with anger, but he spoke quietly and reproved his
      brother-in-law for his rude speech. 'Why insult me needlessly before so
      many strangers?' he said. 'What harm have I or my wife Luisa ever done to
      thee?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Curse thee and Luisa, thy wife,' said Karta again; 'she and thee, aye,
      and Serena too, are well matched, for ye be all cunning sneaks and fit
      company for that fat-faced Samoan psalm-singer who stands beside thee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At these words the three beachcombers laughed, and when they saw that
      Simi made no answer, but turned aside from Karta in contempt, one of them
      called him a coward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He turned upon him quickly. 'Thou liest, thou drunken, useless cumberer
      of the earth,' he said, looking at him scornfully; 'no coward am I, nor a
      noisy boaster like thee. This is no place for us to quarrel. But say such
      a thing to me on the beach if ye dare.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He is my friend/ said Karta, speaking with drunken rage, and thrusting
      his face into Simi's, 'he is as good a man as thee any day. To strike him
      or any one of us thou art afraid, thou cat-hearted coward and miser.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi clenched his hands, but suddenly thrust them into his pockets and
      looked at the captain and the officers of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This is no place for me,' he again said in a low voice; 'come, Tavita,
      let us go,' and without even raising his eyes to Karta and the three other
      men he went out of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That night he, Luisa, and I and my wife sat talking; and in the fulness
      of her anger at the insults heaped upon her husband, Luisa told us of some
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This man Karta hateth both my sister and myself, as well as my husband.
      He hateth me because that it was I whom he desired to marry, four years
      ago; but I feared him too much to become his wife, for even in those days
      I knew him to be a drunkard and a gambler, and a licentious man. Then
      although she loved him not my sister Serena became his wife, for he was a
      man of good property, and promised to give over his evil ways and be a
      good husband to her. And he hateth her and would gladly see her dead, for
      she hath borne him no children. He is for ever flinging cruel words at
      her, and hath said to her before me that a childless man is a thing of
      scorn and disgrace even to the savage people of this island. And he makes
      no secret of his wickedness with other women. That is why my sister Serena
      is dull and heavy-minded; for she is eaten up with grief and shame.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That is true,' said Simi, 'I have known this for a year past, for when
      he is drunk he cannot conceal his thoughts. And he is full of anger
      against me because I have nought in common with him. I am neither a
      drinker of grog nor a gambler, and have suffered from him what I would
      suffer from no other man. I am no brawler, but yet 'tis hard to bear.'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as dawn came, and I was sunk in slumber, I heard a footstep outside
      my door, and then Simi called to me. 'Bring thy wife to my house quickly,'
      he said, 'evil work hath been done in the night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife and I followed him, and when we entered we saw Luisa his wife
      kneeling beside a couch and weeping over Serena, who lay still and quiet
      as if dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Look,' he said sternly, 'look what that devil hath done!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lifted Serena's left arm&mdash;the bone was broken in two places,
      above and below the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We set to work quickly, and fitting the broken bones in place we bound
      her arm up in stiff, smooth strips of the spathe of the cocoanut tree, and
      then washed and dressed her feet, which were cut and bleeding, for she had
      walked barefooted, and clothed only in her night-dress, all the way from
      the north end of the island, which is nearly two leagues from my house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After she had drunk some coffee and eaten a little food she became
      stronger, and told us all that had befallen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Karta and the three other white men came back from the ship when it was
      long past midnight, and I knew by the noise they made that they had all
      been drinking grog. I heard them talking and laughing and saying that
      thou, Simi, were a paltry coward; and then one of them&mdash;he who is
      called Joe&mdash;said that he would one day end thee with a bullet and
      take Luisa to wife, as so fine a woman deserved a better man than a cur
      for a husband. And Karta&mdash;Karta my husband&mdash;laughed and said
      that that could not be, for he meant to take thee, Luisa, for himself when
      he had ridden himself of me. His shameless words stung me, and I wept
      silently as I lay there, and pressed my hands to my ears to shut out their
      foul talk and blasphemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Suddenly I heard my husband's voice as he rose from the table and came
      towards the sleeping room. He threw open the door and bade me come out and
      put food before him and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I rose at his bidding, for his face terrified me&mdash;it was the face
      of a devil&mdash;and began to clothe myself. He tore the dress from my
      hands and cursed me, and bade me go as I stood. In my fear I sprang to the
      window and tried to tear down the cane lattice-work so as to escape from
      the house and the shame he sought to put upon me. He seized me by the
      waist and tried to tear me away, but I was strong&mdash;strong with the
      strength of a man. Then it was that he went mad, for he took up a heavy <i>paua</i>
      stick and struck me twice on the arm. And had it not been that the other
      white men came in and dragged him away from me, crying shame on him, and
      throwing him down upon the floor, I would now be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I lay quiet for a little time and then rising to my feet looked out into
      the big room, where the three men were still holding my husband down. One
      of them bade me run for my life, for Karta, he said, had gone mad with
      grog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I feared to seek aid from any of the natives, for they, too, dread Karta
      at such times; so I walked and ran, sometimes along the beach, sometimes
      through the bush till I came here. That is all.'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;That morning the head man in our village caused the shell to sound,{*} to
      call the people together so that they might hear from Simi the story of
      the shame put upon his wife's sister and upon himself and his house. As
      the people gathered around the <i>moniep</i>{**} and the head men sat down
      inside, the captain of the ship came on shore, and great was his anger
      when he heard the tale.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A conch-shell.

     ** The council house.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Let this poor woman come to my ship,' he said; 'her life here is not
      safe with such a man as that. For I know his utter vileness and cruelty to
      her. With me she shall be safe and well cared for, and if she so wishes
      she shall come with me to Fiji where my wife liveth, and her life will be
      a life of peace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Serena was put in the ship's boat, and Luisa went with her to remain
      on board till the ship sailed, which would be in three days. Then Simi and
      the head men talked together in the council house, and they made a law and
      sent a message to Karta. This was the message they sent to him: 'Because
      of the evil thou hast done and of the shame thou hast put upon the sister
      of the wife of our white man, come no more to this town. If thou comest
      then will there be war between thy town and ours, and we will burn the
      houses and harry and slay thee and the seven other white men, and all men
      of thy town who side with thee, and make slaves of the women and children.
      This is our last word.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A swift messenger was sent. Before the sun was in mid-heaven he returned,
      crying out as he ran, 'War is the answer of Karta and his village. War and
      death to Simi and to us all are his words; and to Luisa, the wife of the
      white man, he sendeth this message: &ldquo;Prepare a feast for thy new husband,
      for he cometh to take thee away from one who cannot stand against him.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In those days there were seven hundred fighting men in our town, and a
      great clamour arose. Spears and clubs and muskets and hatchets were
      seized, the armour of stout cinnet which covered a man from head to foot
      was put on, women filled baskets with smooth stones for the slings; and
      long before sundown the warriors set out, with Simi and the head men
      leading them, to meet their enemies mid-way&mdash;at this very place where
      we now sit. For this narrow strip of land hath been the fighting-ground of
      Peru from the old, old times long before I was born, and my years are
      three score and seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night was dark, but Simi and his people, when they reached this
      place, some by land and some in canoes, lit great fires on the beach and
      dug trenches in the sand very quickly, behind which all those who carried
      muskets were placed, to fire into the enemy's canoes as they paddled along
      the narrow passage to the landing place. Karta and his white friends and
      the people of their town had more than two hundred muskets, whilst our
      village had less than fifty. But they were strong of heart and waited
      eagerly for the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just before sunrise we saw them coming. There were over one hundred
      canoes, each carrying five or six men. Karta and the beachcombers were
      leading in a whaleboat, which was being rowed very swiftly. When within
      rifle-shot she grounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As they leapt out of the boat, rifles in hand, they were followed by
      their natives, but our people fired a volley together, and two of the
      white men and many of their people fell dead in the shallow water. Then
      Simi and twenty of our best men leapt out of their trenches and dashed
      into the water to meet them. Karta was in advance of them all, and when he
      saw Simi he raised his rifle and fired. The bullet missed the white man
      but killed a native behind him. Then Karta, throwing away his rifle, took
      two pistols from his belt and shot twice at Simi who was now quite close
      to him. These bullets, too, did Simi no harm, for taking a steady aim at
      his foe he shot him through the body, and as Karta fell upon his side one
      of our people leapt on him and held his head under the water till there
      was no more life in his wicked heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fight was soon ended, for seeing three of their number killed so
      quickly, the rest of the white men ran back to their boat and tried to
      float her again; and then Simi, taking a shot-gun loaded with slugs from
      one of his men, ran up to them and shot dead the one named Joe. The other
      white men he let escape, for all their followers were now paddling off or
      swimming to the other side of the lagoon, and Simi was no lover of
      bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That day the people at the north end sent a message for peace, and peace
      was made, for our people had lost but one man killed, so the thing was
      ended well for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serena came back from the ship, for now that Karta was dead she had no
      fear. The three white men who were spared soon left Peru in a whale-ship,
      for they feared to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi and his wife and children and Serena did not long stay with us, for
      he sold his house and boats to a new trader who came to the island about a
      month after the fight, and they went away to live at a place in Fiji
      called Yasawa. They were very good to me and mine, and I was sore in my
      heart to see the ship sail away with them, and at night I felt very lonely
      for a long time, knowing that I should see them no more.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE BRASS GUN OF THE BUCCANEERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Challoner was a trader at Jakoits Harbour in Ponapé, one of the loveliest
      of the great Caroline Archipelago in the North Pacific. He was a quiet but
      determined-looking man of fifty, and at the time of this story had been
      living on Ponapé for over five years. Unlike the generality of the white
      men who were settled on the island, he never carried arms and never
      entered into any of the disputes that too often occurred among them and
      ended in bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of his neighbours were scoundrels and ruffians of the deepest dye&mdash;deserters
      from whale-ships and men-of-war, or escaped criminals from California and
      the Australian colonies. Some of these earned a living by trading with the
      natives for turtle-shell and cocoanut oil, others were simply
      beachcombers, who attached themselves to the leading chiefs and gave their
      services to them in war time, receiving in return houses and land, and
      spending their lives in time of peace in the wildest dissipation and
      excesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days the American whaling fleet made Jakoits and the other three
      harbours on the beautiful island their rendezvous before sailing northward
      to the coasts of Japan and Siberia. Sometimes there would be as many as
      thirty ships arrive within a week of each other, carrying from thirty to
      forty hands each; and these, when given liberty by their captains, at once
      associated with the beachcombing element, and turned an island paradise
      into a hell during their stay on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was among these beachcombers a man named Larmer. He was of Herculean
      stature and strength, and was, in a manner, their leader. It was his habit
      in his drunken moments to vaunt of the bloody deeds which he had
      perpetrated during his crime-stained career in the Pacific Islands. For
      the lives of natives he had absolutely no regard, and had committed so
      many murders in the Gilbert Islands that he had been forcibly taken on
      board a whaler by the few white men living there, and threatened with
      instant death if he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whaleship landed him on Ponapé, and his presence soon became a curse.
      Being possessed of plenty of arms and ammunition, he soon gained the
      friendship of a native chief ruling over the western district of the
      island, and his savage nature at once showed itself by his offering to
      destroy the inhabitants of a little island named Pàkin, who had in some
      way offended this chief. His offer was accepted, and, accompanied by five
      ruffianly whites and some hundreds of natives, the unfortunate people were
      surprised and butchered. Elated with this achievement, Larmer returned to
      Ponapé, and, during the orgy which took place to celebrate the massacre,
      he shot dead one of his white companions who had displeased him over some
      trifling matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was brought by a native to Challoner, who with a fellow-trader
      and several local chiefs was sitting outside his house smoking and
      enjoying the cool of the evening, and watching the flashing torches of a
      number of canoes catching flying fish beyond the barrier reef. Neither of
      them felt surprised, and Challoner remarked to the native that it was good
      to know that one bad and useless man was dead, but that it would be better
      still to hear that the man who slaughtered a whole community in cold blood
      was dead also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't have said that if I were you,&rdquo; said Dawson, the other trader,
      nervously; &ldquo;that fellow Larmer is bound to hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite prepared,&rdquo; Challoner replied quietly, &ldquo;as you know, Dawson.
      Things cannot go on like this. I have never killed a man in my life, but
      to kill such a brute as Larmer would be a good action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The distance between Challoner's place and Kiti, where Larmer dwelt with
      his villainous associates, was but ten miles. Yet, although Larmer had now
      been living on the island for a year, Challoner had only once met and
      spoken to him.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      During a visit which he (Challoner) had made to a little harbour called
      Metalanim, he had explored some very ancient ruins there, which were
      generally believed by the white uneducated traders to have been
      constructed by the old buccaneers, though the most learned antiquarians
      confess themselves puzzled to solve the mystery of their existence. But
      that these ruins had been used as a <i>depot</i> or refuge of some sort by
      those who sailed the North Pacific more than two hundred years ago was
      evident, for many traces of their occupancy by Europeans had been found by
      the few white men who had visited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Challoner's fortune to discover amid the mass of tangled vines and
      creepers that grew all over the walls, and even down in the curious
      chambers, an old brass cannon. With the aid of some of his native friends
      he succeeded in dragging it forth and conveying it in his boat to his
      house, where, upon cleaning it, he found it bore the Spanish arms over the
      date of its casting in Manila, in the year 1716. Much interested in this,
      he refused to sell the gun to several whaleship captains, who each wanted
      to buy it. He would sell it, he thought, to better advantage by sending it
      to Australia or Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after its discovery he had set his people to work to clean and polish
      it One day he saw coming towards him a man, who from his huge figure he
      knew must be Larmer, the beachcomber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, boss,&rdquo; said the man roughly, &ldquo;let's have a look at that cannon
      you've found, will yar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said Challoner quietly, pointing to his boat-house, but not
      deigning to accompany the beachcomber and show him the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larmer made a brief but keen inspection, and then walked into the trader's
      room and, unasked, sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as good as new,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What do you want for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not sell it,&rdquo; replied the trader coldly, eyeing the beachcomber
      steadily, &ldquo;at least to no one in Ponapé. There is too free a display of
      and use of arms here as it is,&rdquo; and he looked pointedly at the brace of
      heavy Colt's revolvers in his visitor's belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scowl darkened Larmer's face. &ldquo;I'll give you a hundred dollars for the
      thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want it, and I mean to have it&rdquo; And he rose and dashed
      his huge hand down upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Challoner was unarmed, but his face betrayed neither fear nor any other
      emotion. He was standing with his back to the doorway of his bedroom. A
      thick curtain of navy blue calico concealed the interior of this room from
      the view of any one in the living room, and Larmer had seen no one but the
      trader about.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some few seconds there was silence; the beachcomber, with his clenched
      fist still on the table, was trying to discover whether the man before him
      was intimidated. Challoner stood unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; began Larmer again, &ldquo;I want that cannon. Sru, the chief of Kiti,
      an' me is going on a little war-party again. But I'll pay you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you that I won't sell it. Least of all to a man like you, who
      would use it for murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beachcomber's hand went to his belt&mdash;and stayed there, as the
      trader stepped aside from the doorway and he saw a rifle pointed at his
      heart. It was held by the trader's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put up your hands,&rdquo; said Challoner, with a contemptuous laugh. &ldquo;And now
      listen to me. I want no quarrel with you&mdash;don't force one on me. Now
      clear out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the baffled man turned away. But the look of savage hatred
      that gleamed in his fierce eyes told Challoner that he had made a
      dangerous enemy. And only a few days passed before he heard from the
      natives that Larmer said he would have his revenge&mdash;and the brass gun
      as well&mdash;before many months were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the trader, though apparently taking no heed, was yet watchful. His
      influence with the natives of the Jakoits district was great, for they
      both liked and trusted him as a just and honourable man, and he knew that
      they would rally round him if Larmer attempted either to carry off the gun
      or do harm to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some months matters went on at Jakoits very quietly, and the last of
      the whaling fleet having sailed, Challoner and Dawson went about their
      usual work again, such as trading along the coast in their whaleboats and
      storing their cocoanut oil in readiness for the <i>Mocassin</i>, the
      trading ship which visited them once a year, and was now due.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although living only a few miles apart from each other, the two did not
      very often meet, but Challoner was one day surprised to see Dawson's boat
      pulling into the beach, for he had had a visit from his friend only the
      previous evening. The moment the boat touched the sand Dawson jumped out,
      and Challoner at once saw by the anxious expression on his face that
      something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon learnt Dawson's news, which was bad enough. The <i>Mocassin</i>
      had run ashore in the night at a place five miles away from Dawson's
      village, and it was feared she would become a total wreck unless she could
      be lightened and floated over the reef into smooth water. The captain had
      sent an urgent message for aid, and in less than half an hour the two men
      were on their way to the wreck, accompanied by nearly every male native in
      Challoner's village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards sunset on the following day, just as the boats were in sight,
      returning from the wreck, Tiaru, the trader's wife, with her one child and
      some of her female relatives, were coming from their bathe in the sea,
      when they heard screams from the village, and presently some terrified
      women fled past them, calling out that Larmer and another white man and a
      number of their native allies were carrying away the brass gun. In an
      instant the young wife gave the babe to a woman near her, and darted
      towards her husband's house. A number of women and children, encouraged by
      her presence, ran to alarm the approaching boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the trader's house Larmer and another beachcomber were
      directing a score of Kiti natives how to sling the heavy gun between two
      stout poles. A sentry stood on guard at the gate of Challoner's fence, but
      Tiaru dashed his crossed musket aside, and then sprang into the midst of
      her husband's enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set down the gun,&rdquo; she panted indignantly, &ldquo;ye coward men of Rôan Kiti,
      and ye white men thieves, who only dare to come and steal when there are
      but women to meet and fight with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Larmer laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out o' this, you meddling fool,&rdquo; he said in English, and then,
      calling to the natives to hasten ere it grew dark, he took no further
      notice of the woman before him. Then, as they prepared to raise their
      burden by a united effort upon their naked shoulders, Tiaru sprang into
      the house and quickly reappeared with a heavy knife in her hand. Twisting
      her lithe body from the grasp of one of the beachcombers, with flaming
      eyes she burst in amongst the gun carriers and began slashing at the
      strips of green bark with which the cannon was lashed to the poles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; said Larmer fiercely, striding forward and seizing her by her
      long hair. &ldquo;Take away her knife, Watty, quick!&rdquo; And he dragged her head
      back with brutal strength&mdash;to release his hold with a cry of savage
      fury as the woman turned upon him and with a swift stroke severed the
      fingers of his left hand. Again she raised her hand as Larmer drew a
      pistol and shot her through the body. She fell without a cry upon the gun
      beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, you've done it now!&rdquo; said the man
    </p>
    <p>
      Watty. &ldquo;Look there! There's all our natives running away. We're as good as
      dead men if we stay here five minutes longer. I'm off anyway&rdquo;; and then,
      hurriedly binding up his companion's bleeding hand, he disappeared into
      the surrounding forest after his native allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments Larmer stood irresolute, looking first at the body of
      the woman lying across the gun, then at his wounded hand. Already the
      shouts of Challoner's natives sounded near, and he knew that the boats had
      reached the beach. The gun, which had cost him so dear, must be abandoned,
      but he would take a further revenge upon its owner. He ran quickly to a
      fire which burned dimly in Challoner's cooking-house, lit a bunch of dried
      palm leaves, and thrust it into the thatch of the dwelling-house. Then he
      struck into the jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Challoner, followed by Dawson and the men of Jakoits village, rushed
      along the narrow path that led to his house, they heard the roar and
      crackle of the flames; when they gained the open they saw the bright light
      shining on the old cannon, whose polished brass was stained and streaked
      with red. Tiaru lay across the breech, dead.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      For nearly two days Challoner and his natives followed the tracks of the
      murderer into the heart of the mountain forest of Ponapé. Dawson and
      another party had left early the same night for the Rôan Kiti coast, where
      they landed and formed a cordon, which it would be impossible for Larmer
      to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watty, his fellow-scoundrel, was captured early next morning. He had lost
      his way and was lying asleep beside a fire on the banks of a small stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was promptly shot by Dawson. Larmer was to be taken alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Challoner and his men pressed steadily on, driving their prey
      before them. At noon on the second day they caught sight of his huge
      figure ascending a rocky spur, and a party of natives ran swiftly to its
      base and hid at the margin of a small, deep pool. Challoner knew that his
      man wanted a drink, and would soon descend the spur to get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some hours not a sound broke the silence, then a stone rolled down,
      and presently Larmer's head appeared above a boulder. He looked carefully
      round, and then, finding all quiet, began the descent. On the very edge of
      the pool he again stopped and listened, holding his pistol at full cock.
      His left hand was slung to his chest by a piece of green hibiscus bark,
      which was passed round his neck and roughly tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence all around him was reassuring, but he still held out the
      pistol as he bent his knees to drink. Ere his lips could touch the water
      two half-naked figures sprang upon him and bore him down. He was too weak
      to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not bind him,&rdquo; said Challoner, &ldquo;but tie his right hand behind his
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Larmer turned his bloodshot eyes upon the trader, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him a drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A native placed a gourd of water to his lips. He drank greedily. Then, in
      silence, Challoner and his men began their march back.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      At sunset the people of Jakoits gathered together in front of the
      blackened space whereon the trader's house had stood. Raised on four heavy
      blocks of stone was the still blood-stained cannon, and bound with his
      back to its muzzle was Larmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Challoner made a sign, the brown-skinned men and women moved quickly apart
      in two parties, one on each side of the gun. Then Rul, the chief of the
      Jakoits* village, advanced with a lighted stick, touched the priming, and
      sprang aside. A sheet of flame leaped out, a bursting roar pealed through
      the leafy forest aisles, and Challoner had avenged his murdered wife.
